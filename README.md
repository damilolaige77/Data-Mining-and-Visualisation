The **WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) Lab** at Fordham University collected a comprehensive dataset from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of smartphones and smartwatches, involving 51 subjects performing 18 diverse activities of daily living. Each subject performed these activities for 3 minutes, contributing 54 minutes of sensor data per individual. The activities include ambulation-related actions (e.g., walking, jogging, climbing stairs), hand-based activities (e.g., brushing teeth, folding clothes), and eating activities (e.g., eating pasta, chips). The dataset comprises time-series data from both the phone's and watch's accelerometers and gyroscopes, tagged with activity labels and subject identifiers, enabling its use for biometric and activity recognition model development.

Researchers employed a sliding window approach to transform the raw time-series data into labeled examples for easier model training, and these transformation scripts, along with the processed data, are provided within the dataset. The dataset is publicly available via the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the **WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset**, facilitating further research in activity recognition and biometric identification.
